# Log of #100DaysofCode - Started June 22, 2020

### Day 1: June 22, 2020 (Monday)
**Today's Progress**: I'm already on Week 2 of HarvardX CS50. I think it's really helping get in the right state of mind
as I commit to really learn how to code and make all those projects I think about a reality. Today I submitted the Caesar
problem. Con? I spent 2 hours staring at the equation, and it all clicked after I realized I was using the wrong inputs.
Facepalm. Pro? The actual coding in C was practically painless. I'm really enjoying so far!

**Thoughts**: I'm 26 and I can't believe I thought I was way too old to switch careers. I feel really encouraged that I can do
this.

### Day 2: June 23, 2020 (Tuesday)
**Today's Progess**: Watched Week 3 Lecture. I've decided to space the main lecture, supplementary videos, and problem sets
on different days just so I don't get bogged down. I'm trying to "attend" this like a real class, and man do I miss college.

I also finished FreeCodeCamp's HTML and HTML5 lessons. Is it possible I'm trying to learn too many things at once? Well, as long as these bits and pieces are being used towards a final project (my interactive fanfiction project... hahaha) then it should be okay.

Another project concurrent to CS50 is learning Twine. I have sooo many unfinished Twine and story projects, and I want to take
this opportunity to turn it more interesting by creating interactive experiences. I started a tutorial because my only knowledge of Twine previous to this was scene to scene to scene. And now I'm making inventories and stuff. Already going through some JavaScript stuff. Crazy!

**Thoughts**: To keep myself accountable, I should probably post these on Instagram. I might be able to make journey-mates there.

### Day 3: June 24, 2020 (Wednesday)
**Today's Progress**: Focused on FreeCodeCamp's CSS for beginners walkthrough. This will be useful for my CYOA game I **need** to finish by August. I'm creating it in Harlowe, but I think I need to move it to Sugarcube just so it's more robust. My fear is really making the scope so big. Everything just gets so much more complex the longer I am staring at it. But this labor of love should just be simple. I've already mapped out the game in my head, plus the datamaps and variables and whatnot that I have to include. What's important is the writing of course, but gosh, I'm excited to share this with fellow fans, haha.

I watched the CS50 Week 3 shorts and looked at the Plurality problem set. It seems simple but ya really have to catch the hints in the lecture and such to get it correctly. I'm pretty proud of myself for not really being a chump on the coding part, but the mathematical thinking really stumps me. I'm an embarassment of a Management Engineering student, yikes.

**Thoughts**: Confession: before the start of this commitment to learning how to code earlier this month, I have started typing while looking at the screen. I'm 26 years of age but I have been typing while looking at the keyboard all my life. I'm an embarassment HAHAHA. But now that I've been typing more that aren't just short emails and such, I've watched the words form and my fingers just move super rapidly.

### Day 4: June 25, 2020 (Thursday)
**Today's Progress**: Felt really dumb for the first Problem Set. I feel like I need to allott a day on each part. Thinks click after I walk away after an hour. An then boom I understand. I felt kind of bad for not being able to do it as quickly as I'd like. But that's how it goes. I think my pacing is okay and that I'm keeping a strict weekly schedule so I don't slip.

**Thoughts**: This amount of information that you have to discern which parts are useful at the given moment in time reminds me so much of college. I can't believe I pushed through all of that. Now is another crunch time, understanding concepts kind of learning system. Gotta digest this ASAP.
