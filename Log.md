# Log of #100DaysofCode - Started December 1, 2020

### Day 1: December 1, 2020 (Monday)
**Today's Progress**: I'm back! I had an incredible run in early June, but bad stuff happened and I was really derailed. now I'm back, with 3 weeks left for CS50 - and I really believe I can finish this before the year ends - and learning Python for...
...Ren'Py! There is a game writing job I'm looking out for and I promised my prepped portfolio for this coming Friday. I don't know how much of a shot I have, but I'm hoping it will get me somewhere, at the very least, so I'm doing a mini-game jam for myself HAHAHA and... at the very least (again) I have something initial in my portfolio. Gotta start somewhere.

**Thoughts**: It feels good to be progressing again. I hope that it really comes along.
