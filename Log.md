# Log of #100DaysofCode - Started June 22, 2020

### Day 1: June 22, 2020 (Monday)
**Today's Progress**: I'm already on Week 2 of HarvardX CS50. I think it's really helping get in the right state of mind
as I commit to really learn how to code and make all those projects I think about a reality. Today I submitted the Caesar
problem. Con? I spent 2 hours staring at the equation, and it all clicked after I realized I was using the wrong inputs.
Facepalm. Pro? The actual coding in C was practically painless. I'm really enjoying so far!

**Thoughts**: I'm 26 and I can't believe I thought I was way too old to switch careers. I feel really encouraged that I can do
this.

### Day 2: June 23, 2020 (Tuesday)
**Today's Progess**: Watched Week 3 Lecture. I've decided to space the main lecture, supplementary videos, and problem sets
on different days just so I don't get bogged down. I'm trying to "attend" this like a real class, and man do I miss college.

I also finished FreeCodeCamp's HTML and HTML5 lessons. Is it possible I'm trying to learn too many things at once? Well, as long as these bits and pieces are being used towards a final project (my interactive fanfiction project... hahaha) then it should be okay.

Another project concurrent to CS50 is learning Twine. I have sooo many unfinished Twine and story projects, and I want to take
this opportunity to turn it more interesting by creating interactive experiences. I started a tutorial because my only knowledge of Twine previous to this was scene to scene to scene. And now I'm making inventories and stuff. Already going through some JavaScript stuff. Crazy!

**Thoughts**: To keep myself accountable, I should probably post these on Instagram. I might be able to make journey-mates there.

### Day 3: June 24, 2020 (Wednesday)
**Today's Progress**: Focused on FreeCodeCamp's CSS for beginners walkthrough. This will be useful for my CYOA game I **need** to finish by August. I'm creating it in Harlowe, but I think I need to move it to Sugarcube just so it's more robust. My fear is really making the scope so big. Everything just gets so much more complex the longer I am staring at it. But this labor of love should just be simple. I've already mapped out the game in my head, plus the datamaps and variables and whatnot that I have to include. What's important is the writing of course, but gosh, I'm excited to share this with fellow fans, haha.

I watched the CS50 Week 3 shorts and looked at the Plurality problem set. It seems simple but ya really have to catch the hints in the lecture and such to get it correctly. I'm pretty proud of myself for not really being a chump on the coding part, but the mathematical thinking really stumps me. I'm an embarassment of a Management Engineering student, yikes.

**Thoughts**: Confession: before the start of this commitment to learning how to code earlier this month, I have started typing while looking at the screen. I'm 26 years of age but I have been typing while looking at the keyboard all my life. I'm an embarassment HAHAHA. But now that I've been typing more that aren't just short emails and such, I've watched the words form and my fingers just move super rapidly.

### Day 4: June 25, 2020 (Thursday)
**Today's Progress**: Felt really dumb for the first Problem Set. I feel like I need to allott a day on each part. Thinks click after I walk away after an hour. An then boom I understand. I felt kind of bad for not being able to do it as quickly as I'd like. But that's how it goes. I think my pacing is okay and that I'm keeping a strict weekly schedule so I don't slip.

**Thoughts**: This amount of information that you have to discern which parts are useful at the given moment in time reminds me so much of college. I can't believe I pushed through all of that. Now is another crunch time, understanding concepts kind of learning system. Gotta digest this ASAP.

### Day 5: June 26, 2020 (Friday)
**Today's Progress**: Finally finished and submitted Plurality. It really is just a matter of walking away from the part and then coming back. I swear it just clicks after a while! All I had to do was clean up a bit and remind myself of the specific instructions. I am very, very motivated.

**Thoughts**: Entering the CS50 course, I really wanted to make it a point to stretch my brainpower. Never to look at any solutions and just the guides that are available. I swear everytime I am stuck, going back to my man Doug Lloyd (haha)'s videos makes it suddenly click. Like, I look really funny thinking hard at my desk and writing code "running" on my notebook just to understand the concept, but that EUREKA moment is so addicting. Of course these are really simple things, and brings me back to my financial modelling days. 

### Day 6: June 27, 2020 (Saturday)
**Today's Progress**: Yikes, Runoff is taking so much brainpower from me. Six whole functions to piece together. I just got through the first part - and now getting a bit stuck on the 2nd. I guess it really will take walking away and going back, as it so happens. I guess the amount of time I'm spending is just keeping me off schedule. But gotta work through that.

**Thoughts**: ACK! I'm so slow! I really want to commit and not look at any solutions, but my God, I am spending so much time just thinking through something. It makes me feel so dumb. It's really getting me off track but I hope to finish everything by end of August.

### Day 7: June 28, 2020 (Sunday)
**Today's Progress**: Wow... did I say 2 days ago that I was encouraged? Well... This next PSET is doing the roundabout on me and driving me a little crazy. I think I'm gonna take an entire week on it and it's kind made a dent in my schedule. Which is of course very concerning. I want to be able to finish 4 games, 2 apps and 1 website by the end of 2020... so I better get a move on in learning by doing. I have to forgive myself and my foundational programming thinking and just... take my time. Nothing is going to waste. Everytime I feel I spent an eternity on a stupidly simple problem, I have to tell myself I'm starting from scratch here, there's no need to be defeatist. Sigh.

**Thoughts**: I need to divvy up the work better. I was hoping I'd finish CS50 by end July, but with my progress it might end up mid August which is not good for my schedule. By tomorrow I'll make the Sugarcube tutorials and C# tutorials more seriously. And strictly allott 1 hour for CS50.

### Day 8: June 29, 2020 (Monday)
**Today's Progress**: I decided to be kind today and give myself a break. Admittedly I was a lot frustrated by the past two days. I thought I could've finished everything by Sunday, but to no avail. I think it'd be smart to give my brain a but of breathing room. In place of codings stuff, I listened to a CodeNewbie podcast and CSS materials from FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts**: I was thinking I might have bitten off more than I can chew, especially since my freelance business is getting up and running again. But no - I don't wanna abandon another thing like this again. Not again.
