# Log of #100DaysofCode - Started June 22, 2020

### Day 1: June 22, 2020 (Monday)
**Today's Progress**: I'm already on Week 2 of HarvardX CS50. I think it's really helping get in the right state of mind
as I commit to really learn how to code and make all those projects I think about a reality. Today I submitted the Caesar
problem. Con? I spent 2 hours staring at the equation, and it all clicked after I realized I was using the wrong inputs.
Facepalm. Pro? The actual coding in C was practically painless. I'm really enjoying so far!

**Thoughts**: I'm 26 and I can't believe I thought I was way too old to switch careers. I feel really encouraged that I can do
this.
