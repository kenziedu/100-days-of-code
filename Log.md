# Log of #100DaysofCode - Started June 22, 2020

### Day 1: June 22, 2020 (Monday)
**Today's Progress**: I'm already on Week 2 of HarvardX CS50. I think it's really helping get in the right state of mind
as I commit to really learn how to code and make all those projects I think about a reality. Today I submitted the Caesar
problem. Con? I spent 2 hours staring at the equation, and it all clicked after I realized I was using the wrong inputs.
Facepalm. Pro? The actual coding in C was practically painless. I'm really enjoying so far!

**Thoughts**: I'm 26 and I can't believe I thought I was way too old to switch careers. I feel really encouraged that I can do
this.

### Day 2: June 23, 2020 (Tuesday)
**Today's Progess**: Watched Week 3 Lecture. I've decided to space the main lecture, supplementary videos, and problem sets
on different days just so I don't get bogged down. I'm trying to "attend" this like a real class, and man do I miss college.

Another project concurrent to CS50 is learning Twine. I have sooo many unfinished Twine and story projects, and I want to take
this opportunity to turn it more interesting by creating interactive experiences. I started a tutorial because my only knowledge of Twine previous to this was scene to scene to scene. And now I'm making inventories and stuff. Crazy!

**Thoughts**: To keep myself accountable, I should probably post these on Instagram. I might be able to make journey-mates there.
